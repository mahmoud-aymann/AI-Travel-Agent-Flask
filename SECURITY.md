## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep your API keys secure**
   - Never commit API keys to version control
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data
   - Rotate API keys regularly

2. **Use HTTPS in production**
   - Always use HTTPS for production deployments
   - Configure proper SSL certificates

3. **Keep dependencies updated**
   - Regularly update all dependencies
   - Monitor for security advisories

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize data before processing
   - Use parameterized queries

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement proper authentication
   - Use strong password policies
   - Implement rate limiting

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
   - Use secure communication protocols
   - Implement proper logging

## Security Features

### Current Security Measures

- **Environment Variable Protection**: Sensitive data stored in environment variables
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints have rate limiting
- **HTTPS Support**: Secure communication protocols

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Disclosure**: Report vulnerabilities privately first
2. **Coordinated Release**: Work together on fix and disclosure
3. **Credit**: Give credit to security researchers
4. **Timeline**: Provide reasonable time for fixes

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as:
- **Patch releases** for critical vulnerabilities
